# Social Link Prediction with Graph Mining and Random Forest

This project uses graph mining techniques and the Random Forest algorithm to predict whether a link will exist between two nodes in a social network. The features used for prediction are extracted using various graph mining techniques such as node degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The dataset used for this project is the Facebook Social Circles dataset, which consists of ego networks of Facebook users.
## Features

This project includes the following features:

    Graph mining techniques to extract features from social network
    Random Forest algorithm for classification
    Streamlit web application for user interaction
    Visualization of network and link prediction results

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Facebook dataset, which is publicly available on the Kaggle website. The dataset consists of ego networks of Facebook users, where each node represents a user and each edge represents a friendship between two users.
## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

    NetworkX
    NumPy
    Scikit-learn
    Streamlit
